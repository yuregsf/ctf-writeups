0H 	EAX Maximum Input Value for Basic CPUID Information. EBX “Genu” ECX “ntel” EDX “ineI”

01H 	EAX Version Information: Type, Family, Model, and Stepping ID (see Figure 3-6). EBX Bits 07-00: Brand Index. Bits 15-08: CLFLUSH line size (Value ∗ 8 = cache line size in bytes; used also by CLFLUSHOPT). Bits 23-16: Maximum number of addressable IDs for logical processors in this physical package*. Bits 31-24: Initial APIC ID**. ECX Feature Information (see Figure 3-7 and Table 3-10). EDX Feature Information (see Figure 3-8 and Table 3-11). NOTES: * Thenearestpower-of-2integerthatisnotsmallerthanEBX[23:16]isthenumberofuniqueinitialAPIC IDs reserved for addressing different logical processors in a physical package. This field is only valid if CPUID.1.EDX.HTT[bit 28]= 1. ** The 8-bit initial APIC ID in EBX[31:24] is replaced by the 32-bit x2APIC ID, available in Leaf 0BH and Leaf 1FH.
